In case you don't, it understands 6 commands push (with a parameter of type float), pop, add, sub, mul, div\n\nYou may use the application as follows:\n\nType \"parse [filename]\" and it will make a byte file with .run extension which only this program can understand. So cool isn't it?) Note that the parser does not check whether you have done some logical errors like written \"push push\". In this case the error will occur while the program executes and an error message will arise\n\nAfterwards you may type \"run [filename]\" and it tries to run it and prints the result if, of course, you haven't made any mistakes, like tried to pop empty stack.  \n\nIf you want to disasm the file type \"backwards [filename]\" and it will make the file with backwards extension\n\nLast but not least you can just type \"parserun filename\" and it skips the making of the run file phase.")
